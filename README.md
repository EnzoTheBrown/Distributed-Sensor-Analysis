# Distributed-Sensor-Analysis
## Distributed sensor Analysis with Kafka and Spark Streaming


### The goal of this projet is:

1. to determine the trustworthiness of data flow in a resilient cloud at the scale of a smart city. 

2. to detect different kinds of attacks that can happen is a network of camera

3. to analyze at a large scale the content of video flow (follow a person, detect uncommon behaviors, ...) 



### Gear

For this experience, we use a cluster of 6 machines.

### Results

We've been able do determine different kinds of attacks such as replay attacks on a video, DDos, Inpersonation attacks, ...

We didn't add time to push the human detection further than only detecting people on the screen. 
but we have good ideas such as Markov chains in order to analyze the behavior of the entities.
